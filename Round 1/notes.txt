INPUT:
videos, endpoints, request time, no_of_caches, capacity
size of videos (X videos)
Endpoints (X endpoints):
    latency_from_data, no_of_caches_for_endpoint:
        cache id, latency
requests (X <=videos)
video, endpoint, no_of_requests

endpoints [[latency [cacheIds, ...]], 30, 3133,] latency fot i'th endpoint
caches:{chace_id:[[endpoint_id, latency, current_capacity], ...]}
requests [[video_id, endpoint, no_of_requests]] for i'th video
weighted_videos[(video, weight)....]

TWO DIFFERENT DATA PROCESSINGS DON'T GIVE SAME RESULTS
NEW SUBMISSION GIVES LESS SCORE
(found a cause. MORE THAN ONE REQUEST OF A SINGLE VID FFS. just lucky in example)
UPDATE more than one request of a single video from a single endpoint?

WHY ON THURSDAY KITTENS WERE COMPUTED SO FAST?
